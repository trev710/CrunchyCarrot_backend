It is absolutely amazing how perfect a feat of storytelling this is. There are a lot of present day directors who can learn a lot about how to structure and pace a story.

Review.create(likes: rand(1..25), content: "The actors in this movie are generally funny but in this movie, they're the complete opposite. Most of the jokes are flat and to have an entire script base on one character being extremely over weight just doesn't make for a good flick. The acting was decent but overall, it's a poorly written movie. Worth watching on a rainy day.", personal_rating: rand(1..5), user_id: User.all.sample.id, movie_id: Movie.all.sample.id)

Besides this idea being a bit ironic considering the subject matter, I can safely say after a rewatch this film is still incredible, and probably my favorite ever.", personal_rating: rand(1..5), user_id: User.all.sample.id, movie_id: Movie.all.sample.id)
